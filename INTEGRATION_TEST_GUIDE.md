## ðŸ§ª **Testing Flow**

### **Step 1: Skill Tree Navigation**
1. Go to `/admin/skilltree`
2. Click on any leaf node (e.g., "Python", "React", "HTML")
3. âœ… Should navigate to `/admin/courses/skill/{skillTag}`
4. âœ… Should see filtered courses for that skill

### **Step 2: Course Selection**
1. In filtered view, search/sort courses
2. Click on any course card
3. âœ… Should navigate directly to `/admin/courses/{courseId}/roadmap`
4. âœ… Should see interactive roadmap with nodes

### **Step 3: Learning Experience**
1. Click on roadmap nodes
2. âœ… Should open assignment flow modal
3. Complete assignments with 85%+ score
4. âœ… Should see XP notifications and level progress
5. âœ… Nodes should turn green when completed

### **Step 4: Course Completion**
1. Complete all roadmap nodes
2. âœ… Should see course completion celebration
3. âœ… Should automatically show certificate modal
4. âœ… Should be able to download PDF/PNG certificate

### **Step 5: XP System Verification**
1. Check XP display in roadmap header
2. âœ… Should show current level, total XP, progress
3. Complete multiple courses
4. âœ… Should see level-ups and achievements
